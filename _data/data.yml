#        abstract: "This paper examines the effects of improving low-income households' access to high-rent, high-opportunity neighborhoods on the residential equilibrium. Amidst pervasive residential segregation, I study the Small Area Fair Market Rents, a re-design of the rental voucher program that increased subsidies in high-rent neighborhoods and allowed voucher families to relocate there. I find that it led to a more polarized rental market: rents rose in high-rent areas but declined in low-rent areas. In contrast, it fostered a more egalitarian equilibrium in terms of income and racial composition. While high-income non-voucher households experienced a modicum of welfare loss due to increased living costs, low-income counterparts benefited from reduced rents in low-rent neighborhoods. However, I find that the institution of the voucher program itself led to a substantial welfare loss for low-income households, the very population this program aims to assist. This research illustrates the broader implications of housing vouchers, underscoring the need to balance affordable housing, societal integration, and overall welfare. "

        abstract: "This paper examines whether more generous housing subsidies that expand low-income households' access to high-opportunity neighborhoods can generate income gains that offset their own fiscal cost. I study a rental voucher reform that adjusts subsidy ceilings to a finer ZIP code-level rent variation, an approach often criticized for increasing public spending. This presumed trade-off, however, overlooks that income may be endogenous to location. Consistent with positive neighborhood effects, I find that moves to opportunity raise household income, increasing tenant rent contribution and resulting in a net decline in per-voucher federal spending. In high-rent areas, income gains offset higher rents. In low-rent areas, lower payment caps reduce government spending and curb landlord overcharging. However, long-run evidence shows that as more households relocate to high-rent areas, income-driven offsets weaken, costs rise, and program size contracts. These findings highlight real-time feedback effects between improved economic opportunity and the cost of programs that enable it, offering a novel insight in welfare program designs: subsidies can be expanded more efficiently when beneficiary contributions scale with income.

        abstract: "We introduce the concept of <i>racial capital</i>, defined as the collective material and non-material assets of the racial groups to which a child is exposed while growing up, and examine its potential to explain racial disparities in life outcomes that persist even after accounting for a broad range of parental and neighborhood resources. Estimates for Asian, Black, Hispanic, and White children born around 1980 imply that metro-level racial capital measures: (i) have substantial power to explain racial differences in life outcomes, (ii) sharply close and, in many cases, <i>reverse</i> the sign of racial intergenerational mobility gaps in education, income, and employment, and (iii) matter most when <i>racial dissociation</i>, as measured by residential and marriage segregation, is greatest. In contrast to standard estimates, our empirical framework implies a steady state equilibrium that is characterized by near equality for Black and White Americans. The inclusion of racial capital in the model, however, greatly slows the speed of convergence to the steady state, helping to explain the historically slow speed of racial economic convergence in the United States over the past two centuries. Finally, our framework highlights the complementary way that policies related to racial dissociation and wealth transfers affect the speed of convergence across generations. "

        abstract: "In the U.S., Black and white households with identical incomes live in neighborhoods characterized by vastly different economic resources.  This racial neighborhood inequality is present in every major metropolitan area and at all points of the income distribution. We document these patterns using neighborhood income as a summary measure of economic resources and highlight where this form of racial inequality is especially severe. We then examine a series of potential explanatory mechanisms for neighborhood inequality, including decentralized racial sorting, housing discrimination, and racial differences in wealth and home ownership. We conclude with a discussion of how the separate and unequal geography of the American housing market contributes to intergenerational mobility and the speed of racial economic convergence in the United States."
